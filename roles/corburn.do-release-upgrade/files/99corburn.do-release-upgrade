# --force-confold: do not modify the current configuration file, the new version
# is installed with a .dpkg-dist suffix.
# With this option alone, even configuration files that you have not modified are
# left untouched. You need to combine it with --force-confdef to let dpkg
# overwrite configuration files that you have not modified.
#
# --force-confnew: always install the new version of the configuration file, the
# current version is kept in a file with the .dpkg-old suffix.
#
# --force-confdef: ask dpkg to decide alone when it can and prompt otherwise.
# This is the default behavior of dpkg and this option is mainly useful in
# combination with --force-confold.
#
# --force-confmiss: ask dpkg to install the configuration file if itâ€™s currently
# missing (for example because you have removed the file by mistake).
